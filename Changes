Revision history for Perl extension Curio.

{{$NEXT}}

 - Add the default_arguments feature.
 - Quite a few typo fixes, rewordings, and reorganizations of the
   main Curio documentation.
 - When a Curio class is initialized a new fetch() method is now
   generated and installed in the Curio class.  This new fetch() is
   faster as it holds a closure to the factory object instead of
   looking it up every time.
 - Suggest a couple optional, but missing, test dependencies for
   permutations.t to run.
 - Switch to the GNU General Public License version 3.
