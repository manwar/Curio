Revision history for Perl extension Curio.

{{$NEXT}}

 - Always use keys.  It is easy enough to make a single-key Curio
   class.  Supporting no-key classes is just unneeded complexity.

0.07 2019-08-16T18:38:35Z

 - Rather than throw an exception, clear_injection() now returns undef
   if there was not an injection to clear.
 - Added the has_injection() method.
 - Renamed uninject() to clear_injection().

0.06 2019-08-12T23:35:52Z

 - Added the create() and injection() factory methods.
 - Renamed the keys() attribute to declared_keys().

0.05 2019-08-06T20:35:51Z

 - Removed the unused Curio::Factory::find_factory() class method.
 - Fixed injecting so that it actually works!  Also fixed the tests
   which made it seem like it was working.

0.04 2019-07-15T19:46:01Z

 - The exported function may now be overriden with a custom function.
 - Added export_resource.
 - Restored export_function_name and always_export.
 - Added inject_with_guard.
 - Made the Curio::Role::factory method much faster.
 - Renamed registers_resources to does_registry.
 - More documentation work.
 - Added installs_curio_method.

0.03 2019-05-31T02:59:12Z

 - Started the Curio::Manual.
 - Avoid CPANTS test_prereq_matches_use in permutations.t.
 - Fixed a croakf bug that cause croak to just croak the number
   of arguments passed rather than the error message.
 - The generated fetch() method is now named so that in error
   messages it is named "fetch" instead of "ANON".
 - The generated Curio::Declare functions are now named as well.

0.02 2019-05-10T06:50:59Z

 - Support custom Curio class roles.
 - Add the default_arguments feature.
 - Quite a few typo fixes, rewordings, and reorganizations of the
   main Curio documentation.
 - When a Curio class is initialized a new fetch() method is now
   generated and installed in the Curio class.  This new fetch() is
   faster as it holds a closure to the factory object instead of
   looking it up every time.
 - Suggest a couple optional, but missing, test dependencies for
   permutations.t to run.
 - Switch to the GNU General Public License version 3.

0.01 2019-05-09T00:42:15Z

 - First release.
