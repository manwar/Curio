# NAME

Curio - Procurer of fine resources and services.

# SYNOPSIS

Create a Curio class:

```perl
package MyApp::Service::Cache;

use CHI;
use Types::Standard qw( InstanceOf );

use Curio;
use strictures 2;

with 'MooX::BuildArgs';

use Exporter qw( import );
our @EXPORT = qw( myapp_cache );

does_caching;
cache_per_process;

add_key geo_ip => (
    driver => 'Memory',
    global => 0,
);

has chi => (
    is  => 'lazy',
    isa => InstanceOf[ 'CHI::Driver' ],
);

sub _build_chi {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $chi = CHI->new( %{ $self->build_args() } );
    $self->clear_build_args();
    return $chi;
}

sub myapp_cache {
    return __PACKAGE__->fetch( @_ )->chi();
}

1;
```

Then use your new Curio class elsewhere:

```perl
use MyApp::Service::Cache;

my $chi = myapp_cache('geo_ip');
```

# DESCRIPTION

Curio is a library for creating [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo) classes which encapsulate the
construction and retrieval of arbitrary resources.  As a user of this
library you've got two jobs.

First, you create classes in your application which use Curio.  You'll
have one class for each type of resource you want available to your
application as a whole.  So, for example, you'd have a Curio class for
your database connections, another for your graphite client, and perhaps
a third for your CRM client.

Your second job is to then modify your application to use your Curio
classes.  If your application uses an existing framework, such as
[Catalyst](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst) or [Dancer2](https://metacpan.org/pod/Dancer2), then you may want to take a look at the
available ["INTEGRATIONS"](#integrations).

Keep in mind that Curio doesn't just have to be used for connections
to remote services.  It can be used to make singleton classes, as a
ready to go generic object factory, a place to put global application
context information, etc.

From here head on over to the [Curio::Manual](https://metacpan.org/pod/Curio::Manual).

# IMPORT ARGUMENTS

## role

```perl
use Curio role => '::CHI';
use Curio role => 'Curio::Role::CHI';
```

Set this to change the role that is applied to your Curio class.

If the role you specify has a leading `::` it is assumed to be
relative to the `Curio::Role` namespace and will have that appended
to it.  So, if you set the role to `::CHI` it will be automatically
converted to `Curio::Role::CHI`.

See ["AVAILABLE ROLES"](#available-roles) for a list of existing Curio roles.

The default role is [Curio::Role](https://metacpan.org/pod/Curio::Role).

# BOILERPLATE

Near the top of most Curio classes is this line:

```perl
use Curio;
```

Which is exactly the same as:

```perl
use Moo;
use Curio::Declare;
use namespace::clean;
with 'Curio::Role';
__PACKAGE__->initialize();
```

If you're not into the declarative interface, or have some
other reason to switch around this boilerplate, you may copy the
above and modify to fit your needs rather than using this module
directly.

Read more about [Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo) and [namespace::clean](https://metacpan.org/pod/namespace::clean) if you are not
familiar with them.

# MOTIVATION

The main drive behind using Curio is threefold.

1. To avoid the extra complexity of passing around references of shared
resources, such as connections to services.  Often times you'll see
code which passes a connection to a function, which then passes that
on to another function, which then creates an object with the connection
passed as an argument, etc.  This is what is being avoided; it's a messy
way to writer code and prone to error.
2. To have a central place to put object creation logic.  When there is
no central place to put this sort of logic it tends to be haphazardly
copy-pasted and sprinkled all over a codebase making it difficult to
find and change.
3. To not be tied into any single framework as is commonly done today.
There is no reason this sort of logic needs to be framework dependent,
and once it is it makes all sorts of things more difficult, such as
migrating frameworks and writing in-house libraries that are framework
independent.  Yes, Curio is a sort framework itself, but it is a very
slim framework which gets out of your way quickly and is designed for
this one purpose.

These challenges can be solved by Curio and, by solving them,
your applications will be more robust and resilient to change.

# AVAILABLE ROLES

These roles, available on CPAN, provide a base set of functionality
for your Curio classes to wrap around specific resource types.

- [Curio::Role::CHI](https://metacpan.org/pod/Curio::Role::CHI)

Roles for [DBI](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBI) and [DBIx::Class](https://metacpan.org/pod/DBIx::Class) are in the works.

# INTEGRATIONS

The CPAN modules listed here integrate Curio with other things
such as web frameworks.

- [Catalyst::Model::Curio](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst::Model::Curio)

On a related note, take a look at ["Use Curio Directly" in Curio::Manual](https://metacpan.org/pod/Curio::Manual#Use-Curio-Directly).

# SEE ALSO

It is hard to find anything out there on CPAN which is similar to
Curio.

There is [Bread::Board](https://metacpan.org/pod/Bread::Board) but it has a very different take and solves
different problems.

[Catalyst](https://metacpan.org/pod/Catalyst) has its models, but that doesn't really apply since they
are baked into the framework.  The idea is similar though.

Someone started something that looks vaguely similar called [Trinket](https://metacpan.org/pod/Trinket)
(this was one of the names I was considering and found it by accident)
but it never got any love since initial release in 2012 and is incomplete.

Since Curio can do singletons, you may want to check out
[MooX::Singleton](https://metacpan.org/pod/MooX::Singleton) and [MooseX::Singleton](https://metacpan.org/pod/MooseX::Singleton).
